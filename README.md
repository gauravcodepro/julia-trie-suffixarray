# julia-trie-suffixarray

- first part completed: generating the suffix arrays for all the reads and then implementing a trie in RUST to make a node graph. Generate the hashes in less than hour for 40X coverage.
- second part completed : added the CUDA function, converted the string to unicode using a RUST or C++ type map for faster iterations and then storing the unicode as CuArray{Int32}(undefined, length(iter))
- third part: Going to code the additional part with the suffix as $ in RUST so that it can compile the build and will integrate the BLAS and LApack.
