# julia-trie-suffixarray

- implementing the tri suffix array on a node sorted arays for the faster sequence bit search.
- first part completed: generating the suffix arrays for all the reads and then implementing a trie in RUST to make a node graph. Generate the hashes in less than hour for 40X coverage.
- second part: Going to code the additional part with the suffix as $ in RUST so that it can compile the build.
